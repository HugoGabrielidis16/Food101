# Food101

Food101 Project

## Description :

The aim of this project is to achieve a better accuracy on the Food101 dataset than the one described in the orginal paper.

## How to :

I will use transfer learning with an Efficientnet backbone, first as a feature extractor and then fine tuning by unfreezing some layers.
I implemented a basic Baseline model, ResNET50, EfficientNetB0-4 model and a Vision Transformer model

## Framework used :

All models will be created using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Deployment :

At the end of the experience, I will use Docker to make my most performant model, and be able to test it on various image.

## Results :
