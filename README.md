# Food101
Food101 Project


## Description : 
The aim of this project is to achieve a better accuracy on the Food101 dataset than the one described in the orginal paper.

## How to :
I will use transfer learning with efficientnets backbone, first as a featureextractor and then fine tuning unfreezing some layers.
If efficientNetsB0 isn't good enough I will try the B1 model, if i'm not able to achieve 75% with B1 I will do fine tuning on my hyper parameters.

## Framework used :
Since I'am familiar with keras & Tensorflow I will first do it using them and then do it using PyTorch in order to learn it as well.

First :
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
Seco

## Deployment :
Docker container
